# picfun.jl Documentation


This repository implements the particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm described by [Chen et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.05.031). The goal of this project is to study 
how and where machine learning can be used in PIC codes to accelerate the
simulation. Most parts of the code should be differentiable.

This code has been used for [arXiv:2110.12444](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12444)

The documentation is still work in progress. Please check back later or
